# 🧠 NeuralODE_Crypto – Special Problem

This repository contains the source notebooks for my **Special Problem** project in Computer Science. The goal of this study is to explore the use of **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)** in predicting Bitcoin prices and to assess whether incorporating the **Fear and Greed Index**—a market sentiment indicator—improves forecasting performance.

## 🎓 Project Title

**A Time Series Forecasting Model for Bitcoin Using Neural ODEs with Market Sentiment Integration**

## 📁 Contents

- `SP_Neural_ODE.ipynb`  
  Uses Neural ODEs with the Fear and Greed Index as an input feature for prediction.

- `SP_Neural_ODE_w_o_fgi.ipynb`  
  Predicts Bitcoin prices using Neural ODEs without sentiment-based input.

- `Statistics.ipynb`  
  Performs exploratory data analysis and summarizes key trends and correlations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- PyTorch / `torchdiffeq`  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

## 📌 Abstract (Optional)
> This project investigates the effectiveness of Neural ODEs in modeling cryptocurrency time series data, specifically Bitcoin. It compares the predictive performance of models trained with and without the Fear and Greed Index to evaluate the impact of sentiment analysis on financial forecasting accuracy.
